## epirecipes: A cookbook of epidemiological models in R, Python, Julia (and more)

This project aims to collate mathematical models of infectious disease transmission, with implementations in R, Python, and Julia.

Categories of models include:

* Simple deterministic models using ordinary differential equations
  * Standard compartmental models
  * Non-exponential distributions of infectious periods
    * Delay differential equations
    * Method of stages
    * Infection-age models
* Simple stochastic models
  * Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm
  * Discrete time
  * Stochastic differential equations
* Models with time-varying parameters
* Spatial models
* Network models
  * Pair approximations
  * Edge based models
* Applications to specific disease systems

Interactive notebooks are linked from the text, and can be found [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/epirecipes/epicookbook/master?filepath=notebooks).
